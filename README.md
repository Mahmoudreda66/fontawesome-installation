# Using Fontawesome

Fontawesome has free and pro versions, you can download the free version for the web from https://fontawesome.com/download.

#### once you downloaded the kit you will find this folder structure
- css
- js
- less
- metadata
- scss
- sprites
- svgs
- webfonts

all we need is css/all.min.css file and webfonts folder.
copy them into your project. your project structure should be like this:

- index.html
- css/all.min.css
- webfonts

#### calling library
in your index.html file just add
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" src="all.min.css"&gt;

it should work after these steps. to try it just add your icon like this: &lt;i class="fas fa-user"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.
